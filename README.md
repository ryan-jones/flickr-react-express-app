#This is a React-Express Application that generates a photo gallery using the Flickr Api

- run *npm run build* to create a build of the react app.
- *npm run server* will run the express application. The express app will server the react app.
- The flickr API requires a key in order to fetch images. For the sake of this test, my API key is exposed to expedite the review. Afterwards, it will be removed and the api key will need to be handled in your own local environment.
